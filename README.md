# R-CNN-based-Automatic-Vehicle-Number-Plate-Detection

1. This R-CNN based neural network automatically detects number plate and gives us a
bounding box around number plate with confidence score.

2. This CNN model is trained with several car images that are from India and also from
some other countries.

3. The success rate of number plate detection is more than 95% .
